## Kamailio Architecture, Installation and Configuration Labs

Each directory represents a lab

Each directory contains commands for the labs or a completed Kamailio configuration file for that lab

You can make the Kamailio file active by changing into one of the lab directories and activing the following command

```
ln -s $PWD/kamailio.cfg /usr/local/etc/kamailio/kamailio.cf
```

Note, Kamailio is installed in the /usr/local directory
